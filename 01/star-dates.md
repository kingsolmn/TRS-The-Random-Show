# How a Star Trek style star date system could work in the real world
So, in the popular sci-fi world created by Gene Roddenberry _Star Trek_ time and date is largely measured by a 
system know as **"Star Dates"**. The actual basis for creating the "Star Date" used in each episode varies 
widely based on the series, and from what I can tell, even the randomness of the writer's mood for that day.
One thing that I have come to understand is that there seems to be no overall continuity in the fictional 
*Star Date* system.

Recently, I was watching an **Answers with Joe** video that dealt with the calendar systems in history and use
where he went into the randomness that has been our date keeping system at large. But, towards the end of the video 
he breifly touched on how human-kind might use a different date keeping system. This is rightly a valid piont,
as he clearly shows how our current date keeping system is based on the cycles of our planet, how could this system
be valid and effective when we are not anywhere near our own planet? For a few seconds, Joe touches on the UNIX Time
and how that could be the basis of a **"Stellar Calendar"**. That got me thinking that UNIX Time would likely be the 
best basis for a contigous date keeping system that would be valid both on Earth and in deep space.

# How UNIX Time would work as a Star Date system
If we simply take the UNIX Time in a given moment in time, say _1546806000_, and divided it by 100,000 this could give
us something like a star date that is accurate down to a second.
